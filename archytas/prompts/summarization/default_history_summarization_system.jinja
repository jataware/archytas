messages, AI responses, and tool usage and generating a detailed but terse summary of the conversation that can then be
used by other agents to continue long conversations that may exceed the context window.

{% if chat_history.system_message %}

this system message, but instead use the information to inform summarizing the requested messages.
```original system context message
{{ chat_history.system_message.message.content.strip() }}
```
{% endif %}
